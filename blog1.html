	<h1>FIFA BALLON D'OR</h1>
	The FIFA Ballon d'Or, "Golden Ball" was an annual association football award presented to the world's best men's player from 2010 to 2015. A merger between France Football's Ballon 

d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, it was considered the most prestigious individual honour in world football. The FIFA Ballon d'Or was awarded based on votes from 

international journalists and national team coaches and captains, who selected the players they deemed to have performed the best in the previous calendar year.

The six editions of the FIFA Ballon d'Or were dominated by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of their ongoing rivalry. Barcelona's Messi won the inaugural Ballon d'Or in 2010, before 

retaining the title twice. Ronaldo, who plays for Real Madrid, won successive awards in the next two years. The final FIFA Ballon d'Or was presented to Messi in 2015. Its awarding bodies 

subsequently ended their partnership.

For 2016, France Football reintroduced their Ballon d'Or award and FIFA created The Best FIFA Football Awards.
